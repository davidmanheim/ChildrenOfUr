# Potential follow-up work

This is a review-derived, **potential** work list.  It is not a commitment to
change every item, nor evidence that each path is currently user-visible.
Prioritize and verify items before implementation.

## Reliability and compatibility

- ~~Finish replacing raw Redstone mapper query results with typed lists across
  auth, users, auctions, quests, mailbox, buffs, skills, notes, and migrations.~~
  Done 2026-08-27: all remaining raw `dbConn.query` typed-assignment sites in
  coUserver and authServer now `.cast<T>()`; the `PlayerBuff._write` decode cast
  (the live 10-second error loop) is also fixed. A repeat multiline grep for
  `List<T> x = await dbConn.query` finds only a commented-out line.
- Guard nullable/dynamic WebSocket data (`firstConnect`, unknown handlers) and
  client street metadata comparisons. *(Partially done 2026-08-27:
  `street_update_handler.dart` now compares `map['firstConnect'] == true`, and
  the client `collectQuoin` handler tolerates late/unknown quoin responses.
  Remaining: audit other handlers for bare `if (map[...])` boolean conditions.)*
- Isolate other legacy browser APIs behind validated JavaScript adapters and add
  a current-Chromium startup/chat/street smoke test.
- Await and supervise server/auth startup stages; add timeouts and isolate
  individual socket/send failures so one client cannot terminate a service.
- Fix auth logout, verification-table/email handling, and bounded session expiry.
  *(Logout no-op (`SESSIONS.remove([token])`), the URL-encoded email in the
  verification dedupe query, and the `email_verification` table typo fixed
  2026-08-27. Remaining: bounded session expiry — `SESSIONS` still grows
  unbounded in memory with no TTL.)*

## Deployment and security

- Keep local-session authentication strictly development-only; authenticate
  HTTP and WebSocket callers server-side before any public deployment.
- Authorize state-changing APIs and replace reflective client-selected actions
  with an explicit allowlist.
- Restrict CORS, bind development-only services (especially PostgreSQL) to
  loopback, and use non-default secrets and production database authentication.
- Disable stack traces in production HTTP responses.

## Operations and reproducibility

- Add durable, structured application logs with rotation/retention; Docker logs
  currently provide diagnosis only while a container and its log history remain.
- Add health checks, restart policies, and a simple local smoke-check command.
- Pin base images and Dart archives (including checksums), commit compatible
  dependency snapshots, and avoid `pub get` on every service boot.
- Track the root Docker/vendor setup and vendor revision provenance in version
  control; keep generated `.dart_tool` files out of working changes.
- ~~Make server-status metrics work in the image (or replace shell metrics with
  native runtime metrics).~~ Done 2026-08-27: memory uses `ProcessInfo.currentRss`;
  CPU degrades silently to 0.0 when `ps` is unavailable in the image. Weather
  polling is also skipped when no OpenWeatherMap key is configured, removing a
  guaranteed 401 log entry per street load.

## Audio

- ~~Bundle appropriately licensed world music and reference local URLs in the
  music manifest; preserve SoundCloud only as an optional fallback.~~
  Done 2026-08-28: 15 region/hub ambient tracks recovered (YouTube playlist +
  existing zip album), converted to ogg, and wired as a local-file fallback in
  `SoundManager.loadSong()`; SoundCloud remains the fallback path for any
  key without a local file. See `content/music-manifest.json` and
  `RECOVERY_TODO.md`'s "Sound policy" row. Licensing is documented as an
  explicit caveat (fan-preserved, not officially re-hosted), not a resolved
  clean-rights claim.
- Fill the remaining `forest_slow` region gap (no confidently-matched
  source track found) and consider wiring the already-reserved `wintry`
  music.json key to the "Wintry Place" street via a `coUserver`
  `streetdata.json` per-street override, mirroring the existing
  `WintryPlaceHandler` buff special-case.
- Consider reintroducing the original per-region multi-track rotation
  (arrays of several tracks per hub, as in the 2013 game server's
  `ambient_library`) instead of today's one-track-per-key architecture, if
  more source tracks per region are ever recovered.
